# Docker Orchestration and Microservices

This is my workspace for the course: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/docker-orchestration-and/9780134398747/DOCK_07_03.html?autoStart=True

The course has its own repo with all the notes and source code: https://github.com/CADBOT/docker-livelessons-notes  

The original code has been modified to make it runnable in my environment.

Tips on how to enable **GitHub SSH integration** are here: https://github.com/excelsiorsoft/docker-orchestration/blob/master/ssh-agent-on-windows.md 

Each directory roughly corresponds to a lesson in the course.  While the author keeps his notes in *.txt files in the root of his repo, I house mine in the notes.txt files inside individual lesson's directory alongside the corresponding code where relevant.

N.B.: if **'Create Automated Build'** functionality on Docker Hub is to be used, the length of GitHub repo name of the project matters, as described in:

* [this ticket](https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/1172) and 
* [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46290220/repo-name-size-limitation-when-trying-to-create-docker-automated-build). 


I encountered this limitation while working on examples in https://github.com/excelsiorsoft/docker-orchestration/tree/master/lesson-two-dockerizing

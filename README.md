# docker-orchestration

This is my workspace for the course: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/docker-orchestration-and/9780134398747/DOCK_07_03.html?autoStart=True

The course has its own repo with all the notes and source code: https://github.com/CADBOT/docker-livelessons-notes  

The original code has been modified to make it runnable.
